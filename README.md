# p2pnetwork
hi dear users!<br>
i gh=uess it was around three months ago that i decided to start building my own blockchain project. so at first i needed a p2p library to connect nodes on my network and send data between them.
but unfortunately there wasnt any projects to automatically build a network from the ground and add nodes to it and the only things that were available, were simle projects that could only connect to nodes manually and could only send one type message to it.
so basically if someone wants to create a blockchain network, not only they should create the blockchain client app itself, but they also have to create the underlying p2p network for message exchaining as well.
thats why i decided to create a project that could help people create a blockchai however they want without having to deal with the zero layer message system. and while building it i asked myself: why should this project only be for blockchain creators? dont other projects like music shairing, video shairing and... need this?
so i changed the code of the project ""so that it can be compatible with any kind of need""
